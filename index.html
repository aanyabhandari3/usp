									<h2>Research Project: Designing a Microprocessor-Based Heart Rate Monitor for Construction Workers</h2>
									<p><strong>Principal Investigator (PI) Name:</strong> Dr. Aaron Costin</p>
									<p><strong>Institution and Department:</strong> University of Florida, Department of Construction Management</p>
									<p><strong>Affiliation Duration:</strong> Since October 2023</p>
		
									<h3>Research Focus</h3>
									<p>
										This research aims to develop a microprocessor-based heart rate monitor designed to enhance cardiovascular 
										health monitoring for construction workers. The project leverages microprocessor technology to provide 
										real-time, precise heart rate monitoring, allowing workers to actively monitor their physiological state 
										during physically demanding tasks. By mitigating risks associated with overexertion, dehydration, and thermal 
										stress, this project seeks to promote safer work environments and improve overall well-being in the construction 
										industry. Additionally, the data generated from these monitors could drive tailored wellness interventions to 
										enhance both worker safety and operational efficiency.
									</p>

									<h3>Project Responsibilities</h3>
									<p>
										As a member of this research project, I am involved in various aspects of both hardware and software development. 
										My primary responsibilities include assisting with the selection and integration of microprocessors and sensors, 
										such as photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, to capture blood volume changes. I also contribute to the design and 
										implementation of the signal conditioning circuitry, analog-to-digital conversion, and noise reduction strategies 
										to ensure accurate data acquisition. On the software side, I work on writing the firmware in C/C++ to control 
										sensor data collection and processing. Additionally, I participate in the prototyping phase, ensuring that the 
										device meets design specifications through rigorous testing and iterative improvements. I collaborate closely 
										with the team to design a user-friendly interface and contribute to the project's documentation and testing protocols.

									<h2>CourseWork</h2>
									<p>Bhandariâ€™s coursework spans a broad range of subjects in Computer Science and Astrophysics, providing a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of technology and science. Her core classes include advanced topics in data structures, algorithms, and software engineering, complemented by specialized courses in machine learning and artificial intelligence. She has also delved into computational physics and mathematical modeling through her astrophysics minor, which fuels her passion for applying computational techniques to understand complex systems, from celestial bodies to climate dynamics. Aanya's hands-on projects have explored areas like file I/O serialization, command-line compilation, and working with Hamiltonians in quantum systems. She is particularly excited about leveraging this diverse academic background to solve real-world problems in finance, sustainability, and advanced computational research.</p>
